## How to use:
First, download as zip and unpack, or run `git clone https://github.com/flatypus/newtab`. 
This is meant to be a chrome extension, so open chrome extensions in developer mode, click load unpacked, and select this folder.

Kinda inspired by [vincent's start page](https://github.com/vincor-qc/new-startpage) btw<br>
