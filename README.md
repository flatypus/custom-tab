# Hinson's New Tab Page

## Features
<ol>
  <li>Configurable even for non-programmers through the config.js file</li>
  <li>Load custom images in /images, just name them in order and change `numberofimages` in config.js</li>
  <li>Automatically grabs favicons from page when added to the link list, then caches them in local storage to speed up future loads</li>
</ol>

## How to use:
First, download as zip and unpack, or run `git clone https://github.com/flatypus/newtab`. 
This is meant to be a chrome extension, so open chrome extensions in developer mode, click load unpacked, and select this folder.

Kinda inspired by [vincent's start page](https://github.com/vincor-qc/new-startpage) btw<br>
